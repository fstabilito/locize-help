# Is there any visibility on projectâ€™s level of completion that shows how translators are progressing?

If your translators work on locize and not in an other tool - yes. Else the update will be visible when importing the files back you get from the translator (xliff or others). But overall yes... you will notice when you reach 100% in a language.
